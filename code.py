#In genomics, N90 is a metric used to assess the quality of an assembly or sequencing data. 
#It represents the contig or read length at which at least 90% of the total assembly length is contained in contigs or reads of that length or longer.
#Similar to N50, the N90 value is calculated by sorting the contig or read lengths in descending order and then summing the lengths cumulatively. 
#The process continues until the cumulative length reaches or exceeds 90% of the total assembly length. The N90 value is the length of the contig or read at this point.
